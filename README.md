Features:
 * Pages (Model, View Controller based)
 * Blocks (Model, View Controller based)
 * Layouts (Model, View Controller based)
 * Tables (map the database structure)
 * Plugins (have Pages, Blocks and Tables)
 * Vendors (needs proper testing)
 * Helpers (various integrated helper classes)
 * Sophisticated HTML Form creation/validation (even automated validation against database entries)
 * Supports different languages on the fly (via adding xml files)
 * Integrated user management (groups still to come)

 * Fast core (a single file holds everything to reduce disk loading times... needs to be pushed)
