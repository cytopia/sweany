By default, sweany requires a working mysql database
for the plugins to work (see: "Core-Modules and Plugins" below
to deactivate them)


Required steps
--------------------
+ go to usr
+ copy config.php_example to config.php
+ adjust database settings in config.php
+ import db.sql to your mysql database




Missing Log Files
-------------------
Sweany assumes two logfiles in sweany/log
+ core.log
+ custom.log
both have to be writable by the webserver.
If they do not exist, create them.
You can also change the names of them in usr/config.php



Windows Users:
-------------------
If sweany complains about invalid locale in config.php,
you either have to find out your current correct
locale string or set $DEFAULT_LOCALE = 'C'; in config.php



Core-Modules and Plugins
--------------------
If you intend to switch off core modules
and sweany complains, that the plugins do need
those core-modules, you can simple remove the plugins
if you don't need them.

Just remove the plugin folders of the plugins you want to remove from
usr/plugins/<Plugin_Folder>
