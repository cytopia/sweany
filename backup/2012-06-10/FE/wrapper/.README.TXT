view wrappers are essential for all "package" views.
You should not modify the layout of a package view itself,
but rather use the wrapper to do so.

The minimun requirement for a wrapper is one line code:

<?php include($view); ?>


You can wrap around html/css code to include menus, navigation and more stuff to
customize the layout


Folder structure:
-----------------------
wrapper/<package_name>/<controller_name>/wrapper_<view_name>.tpl.php


If there is no custom wrapper, the default wrapper 'default.php.tpl' will be used
and just outputs the view as it is.
