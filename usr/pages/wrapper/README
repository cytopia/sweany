Wrappers are views that can hold a plugin view to customize its surrounding.

Example:
----------
Assume you have a plugin called 'Forums'. Its controller is 'Forum' and
there is a method that defines a view called 'index.tpl.php'.

Then you can create a new folder in this directory, called 'Forums' (named after the plugin name)
and in it place a file called 'index.tpl.php'

In this file then you will automatically have access to the following variables:
+ $view
+ $user
+ $language

The view holds the rendered content of the controller function that uses this view.
$user is the user object
$language is the language object

You can then place custom layout around the working plugin page such as:


<div class="left">
	<?php echo $view; ?>
</div>
<div class="right">
	... custom content...
</div>


Note:
----------
Wrappers are optionally, you do not have to create them.
Only use if you want to customize some stuff
